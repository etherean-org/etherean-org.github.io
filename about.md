Etherean.org is a community dedicated to discussing the big picture: humans, technology, and the connections between them; techno-pragmatism, as opposed to techno-utopianism, with an eye towards avoiding techno-dystopian futures. We believe that tech is wonderful and its power can and must be harnessed for great good, but that tech alone solves nothing.
